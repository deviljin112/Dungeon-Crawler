# Dungeon-Crawler

An actual attempt at finally making a game...

Language:

- :snake: Python / PyGame

## Concept

- Move from room to room defeating monsters and finding loot
- Each room is randomly generated
- Chests, Loot, Resources, Currency etc
- Crafting, Equipment etc
- 3 Styles of classes (Mage, Warrior, Hunter)
- Leveling character and skills
- D&D Turn Based Combat (dice throwing based on skills)
- Each death => Respawn in town
- Town => Only safe area
- Town => Shops, vendors, storage etc
- Death => Lose experiance + maybe gold?
